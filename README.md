some code about homework , like you know

design and develop a volume analysis tool using scripting language like Python, Perl or Linux Shell Scripting. The tool should
1. list the details of each partition, including Starting CHS address, Starting LBA address, size of the partition (MB), and type of partition;
2. provide partition consistency check, particularly displaying a list of unpartitioned disk space if applicable, which are the space on a hard drive that hasn’t been partitioned yet or don’t belong to any partition.

`go run main.go disk1.dd `
